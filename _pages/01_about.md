Hi my name is Steven Moxley, I'm a Computer Programming student at George Brown College.
I love to ride my BMX but also have a serious obsession with Technology and that
is what has led me down this path as a computer programming student.

The languages that I am learning are
* Javascript
* C# - Dislike it though...
* Java

The languages that I am interested in learning are
* Python
* Ruby
* Jekyll/Markdown
* Node/Node.js

I hope to keep learning and obviously have alot to understand but its quite
enjoyable to see a piece of code you written turn into an actual thing.
