Hi my name is Steven Moxley, I'm a Computer Programming student at George Brown College. I love to ride my BMX but also have a serious obsession with Technology and that is what has led me down this path as a computer programming student. My love and persistence within BMX I think gives me a slight advantage for programming because I can't stop until I have either figured it out or I just can't go on.

BMX ❤️ TECH

The languages that I am currently learning are
* Javascript
* C# - Dislike it though...
* Java

The languages that I am interested in learning are
* Python
* Ruby
* Jekyll/Markdown
* Node/Node.js

I hope to keep progressing and obviously have alot of learning and understanding to go but its quite enjoyable to see a piece of code you've written turn into an actual thing. That feeling of accomplishing and seeing a finished product weather in BMX or TECH is the most amazing feeling ever!!!
