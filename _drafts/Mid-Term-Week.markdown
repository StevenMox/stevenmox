So this week is week 7 in our school which means Mid-Terms 🙈🙈🙈 but not to worry a bit of studying and everything should go just fine. As for me I'm gunna study as well as work on some code. The more you code the more you know haha!! It's also my birthday tomorrow... 29 is the age, 1 step closer to hitting what I like to call level 3 haha. It's slightly scary but also at the end of the day it's really just a number and your only ever as old as you feel 😁.
