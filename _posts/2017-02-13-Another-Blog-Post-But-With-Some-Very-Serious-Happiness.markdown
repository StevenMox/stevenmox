So today I finally worked on code, actually javascript code and built a small pong style game and I'm really excited and thought I should not only make a quick blog post about it but also show it within the blog post üòù I don't fully have the best grasp of it all quite yet but I feel as long as I keep at it it's nothing but learning so there is know way it will be bad for me.
