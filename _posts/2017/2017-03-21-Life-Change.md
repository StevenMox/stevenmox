So life is a funny thing, wouldn't you agree? For me it's quite the funny thing and it seems everytime that I am at one of my lower points it just so happens that life seems to come knocking on my door to give me an opportunity to get myself back from the depths of wherever my mind might be wondering. I got a call from Cirque Du Soleil to come and be apart of the new show <a href="https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/volta" target="_blank">Volta</a> that I have been sort of part of since last January or February 2016 if I remember correctly. They are in need of one more guy and it just so happens that not only with the reading that I have been doing but with the way school has been going it just seems to fit perfectly. We came to an arrangment where I could partake in one last week before heading off and then coming back and doing my finals so I don't totally throw my 4th semester away. I'm quite excited for the new adventure and to see what kind of find and wildness we can get into. Sometimes saying 'YES'' is exactly what I need to do and that's what I've done for Cirque. So let's blast off into this new adventure of fun!!!
