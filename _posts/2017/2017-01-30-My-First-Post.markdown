First post and hopefully not the last one. Trying to get myself back into the coding mindset which seems to be alot harder then you think while in school. I seem to always be working on something that doesn't seem to be as much value as
just learning about small things such as how to link stylesheets for CSS. If I don't work on something often I tend to forget it and that is already starting to hinder my coding motivation, so lets change it. Let's talk about it and
lets blog about it and just write CODE!!!

<b>“Don’t think about why you question, simply don’t stop questioning. Don’t worry about what you can’t answer, and don’t try to explain what you can’t know. Curiosity is its own reason. Aren’t you in awe when you contemplate the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure behind reality? And this is the miracle of the human mind — to use its constructions, concepts, and formulas as tools to explain what man sees, feels and touches. Try to comprehend a little more each day. Have holy curiosity.” — Albert Einstein<b>
