Another week of shows completed and what a long week it was. We all pushed through and made the best of every show we did. For our last show of the week we even got a special treat and Christina Aguilera happened to be in MTL and came to see the show. So let's just say the cast was pretty dang excited. She even came and said hey and what an amazing show we put on after the fact.

Two straight dark days (aka days off) followed all the fun that was had after that night and it was so insanley needed. My body is starting to feel basically at 💯 percent again and I'm hella excited to get through this weekend then hang out with the 6ixtape squad when they get here. Fun times on the horizon and well everyday 😄. Time to get to it!!!

<div class="quote"><b>“Most people never get there. They’re afraid or unwilling to demand enough of themselves and take the easy road, the path of least resistance…If you’re not pushing yourself beyond the comfort zone, if you’re not constantly demanding more from yourself–expanding and learning as you go–your choosing a numb existence. Your denying yourself an extraordinary trip.” — Dean Karnazes</b>
