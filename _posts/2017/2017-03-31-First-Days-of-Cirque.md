So after one week in this new amazing and wild adventure I think I can fully say that I made the right decision. Everyone involved has accepted and openly welcomed me to the fam that they have been building for the last 6 months. I'm really excitited that I have intagrated into the BMX side of things so fast and that all the artists as well as all the higher up producers are excitited with the amount of effort I have given to make it all a reality for them. This will hopefully become quite the long lasting fun filled family adventure that was needed in my life and I can't wait to see where we go from here. 🎪🐒🎪🐒🎪
