So as I sit here in the airport and await my flight to MTL I find myself reading again haha 😂 yup me, Mr.never reads and now almost always has a book or some Medium.com article opened. As it goes here is another good medium article <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/dont-take-the-path-of-least-resistance-5dc7ec3f2892#.3vveloygh" target="_blank">Medium.com</a>. My want and joy for this new found love of new knowledge is absolutley astounding to me and it excites me in a way that honestly only my BMX used to. Whether that comes with growing up or just plain finding other things in life that really and truly makes you happy. What ever it is I am truely thankful it has hit me now at a point in life where I was slightly starting to slow and fall again, but now feel re-energized, invigorated and full of want and wonder. Here's to the next life adventure 🍻🍻🍻!!!

<div class="quote"><b>“Most people never get there. They’re afraid or unwilling to demand enough of themselves and take the easy road, the path of least resistance…If you’re not pushing yourself beyond the comfort zone, if you’re not constantly demanding more from yourself–expanding and learning as you go–your choosing a numb existence. Your denying yourself an extraordinary trip.” — Dean Karnazes</b>
