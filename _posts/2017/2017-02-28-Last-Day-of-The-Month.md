So look's like we have made it to the end of my month aka February. That seemed to literally fly by... I almost don't even remember what even happened during the month other than my own birthday haha ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. What I do remember is lots of school, code and biking. Also have gotten very into this idea of reading and already pushed into chapter 5 of <a href="" target="_blank"> The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck.</a> I've essentially only been reading while on the train or when I have a quick few minutes of actual quiet and solitude. Things seem to be on the up and ups in those regards and I can only hope as well as do my best to make sure March is a steller month and the learning never ends. Also I have came accross another developers <a href="http://www.thatsoftwaredude.com" target="-blank" title="The Software Dude">blog/site</a> and he inspired me with this article below about sketching your code. I am a firm believer in the idea that without a written/drawn idea it becomes very hard to do most anything in life, weather that is code or design a product of some sort.
