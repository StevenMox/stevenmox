So I spent this past weekend trying to go through all of my <a href="https://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a> saved links and do as much reading as I could for not only catching up on what I wanted to but also to try and get some more knowledge on certain parts of programming that I don't think I have a firm grasp on still. I also took a quick minute to create and follow a small tutorial to create a random quote generator. As I'm sure it can be seen in all my blog posts I tend to really enjoy a good quote. It's time to start buckling down and just push my way through the last bit of semester 4 so I can start to really work on my own projects and start to enjoy programming again thoroughly. School is just a way to get the brain into a mode of learning but not exactly the way to learn everything, if we wanna learn we must want it ourselves and not just because some teacher tells you this that or the other thing.

And I&#39;m starting to question is it worth it? Well as I am pondering 🤔 this I think I need to remember why I first started doing it and the joy I get when I actually finish and create a project or application. School has been testing my patience with more theory and unrelated code work (aka not coding) then I really feel has been necessary. I&#39;ve been finding it quite hard to throw my whole brain at my own challenges but I think I just need to focus on what I want no matter what 🏫 asks me for because at the end of the day your only ever going to be happy doing what you want 🙃 📱💻🖥 #notbmx #longpostofmeblabbing #sorrynotsorry #keeponkeepingon #coding #codelife #neverstoplearning</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by Steven Moxley (@stevenmox) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2017-03-13T00:29:10+00:00">Mar 12, 2017 at 5:29pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"></script></div>
