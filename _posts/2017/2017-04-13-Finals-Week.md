So the week is finally over!! So many finals crammed into 4 days. Feeling quite relieved while writing this blog post. I got really lucky that all of my teachers that weren't doing there finals this week allowed me to get mine done (truely grateful for the opportunity to at least try). As I sit here in the library quiet zone one last time before taking off to get drinks and food with friends, I ponder to myself will I come back and finish what I started here or is the new adventure gunna take me on one of the wildest rides of my life. I guess I will just have to play everything day by day and go from there right??? The thing about life and what I have been learning recently is we really don't know and the only way we will ever know is by waking up and just enjoying it everyday... to the <b>'FULLEST'</b>. I think that's all for this one just a quick little thank god I can finally get some time off school and I can start to set things in motion the way I want them to be. Hopefully get a chance to sit down and do a bit of a write up about school and such from this last year of my life but first drinks and a plan ride ðŸ›«ðŸ›« SEE YA!!!!
