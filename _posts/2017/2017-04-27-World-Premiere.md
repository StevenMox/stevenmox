Here it is the day that all of the artist's have been working so hard for, it is the World Premiere of our show "Volta". It's been a fun journey even just for me only being here for a single month. So many things had to be done to prepare for this day, from finishing 4th semester, to getting the entire bmx section figured out with timings and choreo, as well as just moving my life to MTL for the next 3 months. This experience has been nothing short of awesome so far and we all are still super excited and can't wait to put on amazing show after amazing show for the Montreal public üòä. I am hoping to do a weekly or bi-weekly update type of schedule with things that go on and the shows themselves. Here's to some fun ones üçª.
