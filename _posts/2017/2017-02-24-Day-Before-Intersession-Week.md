So today's the day! Final Mid-Term's and test's before the week long intersession. I'm very excitited for the week off personally. I have a multitude of things that I am hoping to get done and work on. Also things that need to be finished for certain classes. We have been given the chance to get 2 more java classes to help anybody that is in our program that feels that their initial teachings from a certain teacher who we won't mention here isn't quite up to snuff and they feel they are behind in simple knowledge that they should already know. Since alot of us had such a bad experiance and begining to our programming journey's it's an amazing opportunity and I will be partaking in it for sure myself. Outside of the fun of programming and school the weekend of March 3-5 is a pretty exciting time for BMX in the community of Toronto and the southern Ontario scene. The Toronto BMX-jam will be taking place once again and I can't wait to just get out and see alot of people I rarely see as well as just ride bikes and have fun for an enitre weekend.
