Welcome back to the school life. Back in the library for the last week before heading back to MTL and the cirque family. I just finished writing one final exam and think I did alright on it but I definitely felt the loss of knowledge since being away. I have at least 3 more finals to go before I take off again so I will be doing alot of studying and making sure that I still pass all of my classes. My excititment for school is definitely not at the peak level it once was but I am however excitited to get it done and over with and start focusing on the show and getting into that rhythm before I dive deep into some Javascripting and do many mornings of Tea🍵 and Code💻. Don't have much more to really go on with today but here is a little GIF that I am gunna look at for the next 3 days to help me survive haha 😂😂😂.
