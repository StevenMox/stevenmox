Finally decided to put this out into the wild still not fully stoked on it based on my poorer editing abilities but it will turn into Instagram stuff like everything does nowadays haha!!

So it's long school day Friday and i'm hella hurting from riding bikes last night. Can't stop won't stop though!! I have also signed up for a python course to start working on a bit more code because like I have been saying since the start of this whole thing we definitely don't do enough coding and for me to start learning more I have to do more. I'm excited to see what comes from it all. üòÅ
