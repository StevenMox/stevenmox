So here we go again another week of school... Fingers crossed I'm able to alter my thought process and get a bit more on track for both school and life'ing'. I have decided to try out a new thing even outside the initial blogging, it is to organize my social media life much more aka to limit myself and take the icons and semi hide them from the initial screens I look at to help keep my mind clear and not be tempted to click in and get lost while just browsing nothingness.

I also came across a really amazing article on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/)---------[<b>"BETTER YOURSELF"</b>](https://medium.com/the-mission/bad-habits-you-need-to-kill-immediately-to-be-a-much-better-person-this-year-24c8c7226cbf#.glsdx9d5r)<!---need to figure out how to open in a new tab page-->
