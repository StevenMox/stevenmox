Probably shouldn't even fully consider this a post but more of just a way to say what I am doing lol and what I decided to go ahead and do today. So the weather outside in a February in Ontario,Canada is absolutely insane and I have been able to go on road bike rides....? That doesn't even make logical sense to younger me but I guess that's what global warming is all about. Anyways I decided to get to the book store and pick up what I believe should be a really good help to my javascript program learning. ------ <a href="https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/javascript-and-jquery-interactive-front/9781118531648-item.html?ikwid=javascript&ikwsec=Home&ikwidx=1" target="_blank">Javascript &amp; Jquery</a>
